This code is a simple React application that allows a user to customize their pizza by selecting a size and adding toppings.

The state variables size and toppings are used to store the user's selections. The sizeOptions object is a map of the available size options and their corresponding prices.

The handleSizeChange function is used to handle the user's selection of a pizza size. It updates the size state variable with the selected size. The handleToppingChange function is used to handle the user's selection of pizza toppings. It adds or removes a topping from the toppings state variable depending on whether the topping was already selected or not.

The totalCost variable is used to calculate the total cost of the pizza based on the size and toppings selections.

The return statement renders the JSX for the application. It includes a form with radio buttons for selecting the size and checkboxes for selecting the toppings. It also includes a div element with a summary of the size and toppings selections and the total cost.
